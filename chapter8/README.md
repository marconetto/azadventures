## Notes on cloud init (WIP)

### Scripts executed per boot, and not only at provisioning time

Cloud-init is typically designed for initialization tasks during the instance
first boot process.  It is also a place to add tasks to be executed at the
provisioning phase of the VM, and not tasks to be executed every boot (different
from systemd)â€”but note you can configure it to do so.

To run scripts for every boot, you can use the `per-boot` folder. If one wants
to use cloud-init to run a given scriptin every boot, add the script in
`/var/lib/cloud/scripts/per-boot`. Scripts in this folder are executed in
alphabetical order. Make sure the script has `#!/bin/sh` in its first line and
proper executable permission such as `chmod 744 script.sh`.


### Re-execute a modified cloud init once VM is provisioned

Some times you may get into a situation that you provisioned a VM with a given
cloud-init, but once you are in the VM you realized you made a mistake in the
cloud-init script. You want to quickly fix it to conclude the testing but you
don't want to reprovision the VM.

Basically what you can do is to modify the `runcmd` script:

```
vi  /var/lib/cloud/instance/scripts/runcmd
```

and run cloud-init for that particular cloud-init step (user script):

```
sudo /usr/bin/cloud-init single -n cc_scripts_user
```

Where

- `single`: This is an argument passed to cloud-init, indicating that it should
  run in single mode. In single mode, cloud-init processes only the specified
  configuration set and then exits. This is useful for debugging or testing
  specific configurations without running the entire initialization process.

- `-n cc_scripts_user:` This is another argument passed to cloud-init,
  specifying the name of the configuration set (cc_scripts_user) to be processed
  in single mode. Configuration sets in cloud-init contain instructions for
  customizing the cloud instance, such as running scripts or setting up users.
