# Azure Adventures


**Github Pages:** <https://marconetto.github.io/azadventures/>

Here we have a set of tutorials to work with Azure cloud technologies.

These tutorials represent my personal experience and may be helpful for other
people. They are snapshots in time for a particular question I needed more
investigation or I was just curious about. They may not represent the best
approach to solve a particular problem. Consider as "some notes" with no
warranty at all.

Some of them got (or will get) published at Azure HPC tech blog website
[[LINK]](
https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-high-performance-computing/bg-p/AzureHighPerformanceComputingBlog).

Each folder contains a different tutorial and one tutorial may link to other
tutorials in this repository.
